Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!

This is the second version of the Sunshine code. The repository has been updated on:

* **February 13th, 2015** - Major update
* February 25, 2015 - Minor bug fixes
* March 4th, 2015 - Minor bug fixes

For the original version, please go [here](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine).

A changelog for the course can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/document/d/193xJb_OpcNCqgquMhxPrMh05IEYFXQqt0S6-6YK8gBw/pub).


This repo is in line with the Associate Android Developer exam. Creating a repo for this work was a bit of an oversight so the initial commit to master contains all code from lesson one and some code from lesson 2, in the future each lesson will have its own branch and all commits to that branch will be from that lesson only.
